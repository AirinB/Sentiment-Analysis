# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment Analysi is the process of computationally defining and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially to decide if the writer's attitude toward a specific subject  is positive or negative.

# Dataset

We used the [IMDB](https://www.kaggle.com/columbine/imdb-dataset-sentiment-analysis-in-csv-format), which is categorised 0 - negative or 1 - positive. Also we checked multiple resorces such as [this](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/03/pretrained-word-embeddings-nlp/) one or [this](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/sentiment-analysis-for-text-with-deep-learning-2f0a0c6472b5) in order to gain an overview how other people solve this problem.
